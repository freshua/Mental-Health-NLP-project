#  Mental health assessment by NLP and ML using TensorFlow
Nowadays mental health is an issue of rising concern since people are facing many hardships and difficulties that affect them mentally. Hence keeping a track of your mental health is very important. That is the main motivation behind developing this model. If a person is feeling that he or she might be depressed, they can check out their mental health score. Consequently if their mental health score is low, they can seek professional help and get appropriate treatment for their issues.

The model uses Tensorflow module to predict the mental health of a patient by taking up a small assessment. The model was trained on a bunch of sentences to extract keywords from the input that is the answers given by the patient. And then it analyzes the text using neural networks trained on NLP using TensorFlow and predicts mental health score as an average of score for each answer.
